# Project Title

Database Design & Application 

## Introduction
In this project, we design a database application. We use the phpPgAdmin as our DBMS. The web server is Apache Web Server. The database server is PostgreSQL.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Download the AWS tool MAPP or use the installer (https://bitnami.com/stack/mapp/installer)
included in this directory if using a mac.

### Installing

1. Open AWS tool MAPP installer, start with installation.
Note: Install all the components

2. Set the path for MAPP, since you are going to put html packages and run the AWS through this folder, pick a easy one.

3. Set the web server port, which is going to be used for access the web page on localhost. For example, my port# is 8080, then, when I access web pages on local host, the link looks like “http:// 127.0.0.1:8080/COEN280/businessrule.html”

4. Set the database server port, which is going to be used to connect php DataBase Adaptor with the database server.

For example, my port# is 5433, so my connection looks like

6. Click next, skip the cloud part if you want, then, the installation starts.

7. Go to the folder you install the MAPP

8. Open the manager, and go to manage server page to start both PostgreSQL database server and AWS.




A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
