# Project Title

Database Design & Application 

## Introduction
In this project, we design a database application. We use the phpPgAdmin as our DBMS. The web server is Apache Web Server. The database server is PostgreSQL.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Download the AWS tool MAPP or use the installer (https://bitnami.com/stack/mapp/installer)
included in this directory if using a mac.

### Installing

1. Open AWS tool MAPP installer, start with installation.
Note: Install all the components

2. Set the path for MAPP, since you are going to put html packages and run the AWS through this folder, pick a easy one.

3. Set the web server port, which is going to be used for access the web page on localhost. For example, my port# is 8080, then, when I access web pages on local host, the link looks like “http:// 127.0.0.1:8080/COEN280/businessrule.html”


A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
